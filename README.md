# âˆ€2 Retro Computing Analog VGA Card & PicoPal
![PicoPal Logo](docs/PicoPalLogo.png)

This is a fork of
[David Kuder's version](https://github.com/V2RetroComputing/analog) of
[Mark Aikens' Apple II VGA](https://github.com/markadev/AppleII-VGA/)
project.

The goal of this fork is to make the board cheaper and easier to
produce.  It is now a 2 layer instead of a 4 layer PCB, uses cheaper
bus transceivers and 0603 passive components that are easier to work
with when building the board by hand.

PLEASE DO NOT PRODUCE PCB's FROM THIS DESIGN YET UNLESS YOU'RE
PREPARED TO DEBUG.

Please use
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hanshuebner/AppleII-VGA/issues) to
provide feedback.  THANK YOU!
